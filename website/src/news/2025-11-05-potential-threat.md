title: Mihon could be under threat
description: Misuse of Mihon’s name and branding by a group may endanger the project

Hello everyone,

With Kotatsu's recent shutdown and due to some ongoing issues over the years, I believe Mihon is also under threat. If you care about the project's future, please take a moment to read this message.

### Who is behind the threat, and how?

A group going by iiTachiyomi and recently Miyomi has built a massive following by impersonating Tachiyomi (Mihon's predecessor) across various platform. They only rebranded to iiTachiyomi after years of request and only on platforms where they had a low following.

Their blatant impersonation was one of the key reason behind the legal threat Tachiyomi received, which ultimately led to its shutdown. When we announced Mihon and exposed their behavior, iiTachiyomi promised to change their ways and not impersonate Mihon.

However, just months after Mihon launched, they resumed the same behavior by:
- Creating a new brand "Miyomi: Tachiyomi and Mihon community" to capitalize on Mihon's name
- Posting Mihon release notes and announcements without attribution
- Sharing updates of third-party extension repos without attribution
- Failing to clarify they are not the developers behind Mihon or those extensions
- Selling fake Mihon branded merchandise

### Why does this threaten Mihon?

When P.CoK, the anti-piracy division of Kakao requested the removal of extensions, the Tachiyomi team complied. iiTachiyomi, however continued distributing them in a misleading way, causing confusion that escalated into legal pressure, which resulted in Tachiyomi shutting down.

Now, they are doing the same thing with Mihon. Their misrepresentation and misuse of Mihon’s name, branding and work puts the project at risk, despite Mihon having already corrected the mistakes Tachiyomi made. It could also cause problems for other apps they promote.

### What to do from now on

iiTachiyomi claims to serve the community, but their actions prove otherwise. To protect Mihon: 
- Report iiTachiyomi or Miyomi pages that mislead users
- Correct people who confuse Mihon with iiTachiyomi or Miyomi
- Don’t share or support unofficial Mihon merchandise
- Spread the word: Mihon has no connection to them
