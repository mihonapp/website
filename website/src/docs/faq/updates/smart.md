# Smart updates

Mihon intelligently works to reduce the number of series in a global update to reduce the load on sources. To be updated, a series has to meet the following conditions:

1. **Series Progress**: The series must have been **started**, with at least **one chapter read**.
2. **Ongoing Status**: The series is **not marked Completed** by the source, there's an expectation of more chapters in the future.
3. **Chapter Completion**: The series has **no unread chapters**, you've read all the chapters you already have,
4. **Time Elapsed**: There's been enough time since the last update for the series that **the app predicts a new chapter is available**.

You can see how often the app predicts a new chapter for a series **by looking at the hourglass**.
After that many days, the app will allow that series to check for updates.
