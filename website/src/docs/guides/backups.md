### Syncing backups with external cloud services
Cross device sync in **Mihon** is not currently available, but users can use
[Autosync for Google Drive](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.ttxapps.drivesync)
in order to sync backup files to Drive automatically with the following steps:

1. Install the app from the link above
2. Enable [Automatic Backups](/docs/guides/backups#enabling-automatic-backups) and set it to your desired frequency and storage location.
3. Download the latest backup from Google Drive and restore to whatever device you have

Users who are familiar with [FolderSync](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=dk.tacit.android.foldersync.lite)
or [Tasker](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=net.dinglisch.android.taskerm) can setup auto sync of their backups similarly.

## Additional information for forks
Most Mihon forks support the `.tachibk`/`.proto.gz` format to backup/restore your library, but have specific limitations. Refer to their documentation for more information.
