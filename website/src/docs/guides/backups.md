Before starting to import the selected backup, the app will remind the user of these.

### Transferring downloads to a new installation

## Suggestions for backups

### Enabling automatic backups
It is highly recommended to enable automatic backups to ensure you can recover in case of any issues.

::: tip How to enable automatic backups
1. Go to <nav to="data-and-storage">.
1. Set a **backup frequency** to schedule automatic backups.
This way, you can recover from catastrophic failures.

### Syncing backups with external cloud services
Cross device sync in **Mihon** is not currently available, but users can use
[Autosync for Google Drive](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.ttxapps.drivesync)
in order to sync backup files to Drive automatically with the following steps:

1. Install the app from the link above
2. Enable [Automatic Backups](/docs/guides/backups#enabling-automatic-backups) and set it to your desired frequency and storage location.
3. Download the latest backup from Google Drive and restore to whatever device you have

Users who are familiar with [FolderSync](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=dk.tacit.android.foldersync.lite)
or [Tasker](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=net.dinglisch.android.taskerm) can setup auto sync of their backups similarly.

## Additional information for forks

::: warning
This section explores some extra details regarding [forks](/forks/).
:::

All **Mihon** (and **Tachiyomi**) [forks](/forks/) support the `.tachibk`/`.proto.gz` format to backup/restore your library.

In addition, some forks have specific limitations regarding backup restoration:

- All forks have fork-specific settings and changes that might be saved in Backups.
  Such settings are not restored in **Mihon** and will get lost when creating a new backup.
  > For Example: [TachiyomiSY](/forks/TachiyomiSY/) has the option to backup/restore saved searches.

  These will **NOT** be restored to **Mihon** or its forks.
- Only [TachiyomiAZ](/forks/TachiyomiAZ/) supports creating/restoring both legacy `.json` backups and `.proto.gz` backups.
  > Users are recommended to update their `.json` backups to use the improved and efficient `.tachibk`/`.proto.gz` backups.

Be aware of these limitations when dealing with backups in different **Mihon** and **Tachiyomi** forks.
