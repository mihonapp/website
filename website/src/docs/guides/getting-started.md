### Adding series to your library

After installing the desired extension, you'll find it in the **Sources** tab.

Here's how you can add series to your library:

1. Select the source you'd like to browse.
1. You can use the **Popular**/**Latest** listings to browse, or you can search for the series name.
1. Once you've found the series that you want to add, tap on it for more details.
1. Press the "**Add to library**" button, and the series will be added to your Library, ready to be read!

## Additional setup

### Series search options

If you want to search for series across all your sources, you can use the Global Search feature.

Follow these steps:

1. Go to the "**Browse**" section.
1. Ensure you're on the "**Sources**" tab located at the top-right corner.
1. Use the Search icon in the toolbar to find series from all available sources.

### Trouble finding a specific series?

If you encounter difficulties while searching for a specific series, consider the following points:

* Double-check your spelling and try again, as some sources might use **Japanese romanized** titles instead of **English** ones.
  > Example: **Boku no Hero Academia** instead of **My Hero Academia**.

* Some sources may use different spellings or wordings for titles.
  > Example: **Bungo Stray Dogs** instead of **Bungou Stray Dogs**

  > Example: **3-gatsu no Lion** instead of **Sangatsu no Lion**.
