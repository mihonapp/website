# Source migration
Migration is the process of moving series between sources without losing progress. This is most often used when a source is no longer accessible or another source is more up-to-date.

::: warning
Always make sure to have a backup in case anything unexpected occurs.

::: danger
Downloaded chapter(s) do not transfer with migrations.

Migrations with downloaded chapter(s) may leave the download behind.
You will need to remove these manually with a file manager.
